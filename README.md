A python based automation and scheduler platform, but can be used to acheive a number of things:
* Security incident detection by polling event management solutions
* IT ticket automation, open, close and update tickets
* Automated incident response across IT and security
* Network and vulnerability scanning
* Reduce repetitive tasks
* Carry out remote tasks on servers
* Monitor for threshold and raise alarms
* Use playbooks to run once and/or on version changes

Highly customizable using loops, if logic, variables, in-build functions and easily expandable using plugins
